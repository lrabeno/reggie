\t - match a tab character only

//SPECIAL CHARACTERS

/* 

+ - The one or more quantifier

\ - The escape character

[] - The character set

[^] - The negate symbol in a character set

? - The zero or one quantifier (makes a preceding char optional)

EXAMPLE: /a[a-z]?/
a matches
ab matches because the ? makes the range optionak because it needs to appear 0 or more times

. - Any character whatsoever (except the newline character)

EXAMPLE: /car./
car is NOT a match because we need a 4th character
card matches
car_ matches
car@ matches

* - The 0 or more quantifier (similar to + )
